Problem 64
Odd period square roots

All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions

It can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use
the notation sqrt23 = [4;(1,3,1,8)], to indicate that the block (1,3,1,8)
repeats indefinitely.

The first ten continued fraction representations of (irrational)
square roots are:

sqrt2=[1;(2)], period=1
sqrt3=[1;(1,2)], period=2
sqrt5=[2;(4)], period=1
sqrt6=[2;(2,4)], period=2
sqrt7=[2;(1,1,1,4)], period=4
sqrt8=[2;(1,4)], period=2
sqrt10=[3;(6)], period=1
sqrt11=[3;(3,6)], period=2
sqrt12= [3;(2,6)], period=2
sqrt13=[3;(1,1,1,1,6)], period=5

Exactly four continued fractions, for N <= 13, have an odd period.

How many continued fractions for N <= 10000 have an odd period?
